# Power Offer

## Section 1: Your prospect (WHO)

### Top Desires:

-   “If only I could just launch my app idea without wasting months stuck in tech hell.”
-   “If only I could get to revenue faster without hiring a full dev team.”
-   “If only I had someone technical to guide me through the build, without charging a cofounder's equity.”

### Obstacles

-   Non-technical — they don't know how to build (or manage) the tech
-   Stuck trying to vet freelancers or platforms
-   Don't have the capital or expertise to hire a dev team
-   They may have tried and failed with AI products in the past

### Qualified Prospect Criteria

-   Non-technical founders or soloprenuers with a validated idea (or a strong hypothesis)
-   Willing to invest financially to get an MVP out fast
-   **Bonus:** Has an audience, business or network to get early customers / users

### What they know

-   They're aware that shipping fast (and cheaply) means getting feedback fast (and feedback is the fastest way to PMF and money)
-   They see others getting ahead of them with AI tools, but aren't sure how to get the best results
-   They know that 90% of startups fail, and technical execution problems are one of the top 3 reasons — they can't afford to be in that statistic
-   They've seen the horror stories of founders spending $50k to millions on development only to find out they built the wrong thing
-   They understand that every month of delay means competitors are gaining ground, and the average 6-12 month development cycle is no longer competitive in today's market

## Section 2: YOU

### What are they buying?

They're buying fractional CTO guidance + AI tooling to turn their app idea into a functional MVP — allowing them to get their first paying user faster than ever.

### What it does for them:

By the end of our engagement, they will have a launched MVP with the first version of their product live.

### Common Competitors

-   Nocode agencies with vague timelines and high retainers
-   Freelancers with no product strategy or AI experience
-   Startup studios that want equity, take forever, and aren't incentivized to help them launch quickly
-   DIY nocode tools or AI code creation that they can't fully figure out

### How you're different:

-   You're not just "managing a dev team". You're acting as a true product / tech partner with 10+ years of experience — without taking equity
-   You build fast and launch lean — with a clear plan to get to customer #1 by day 30
-   You've built for top brands, so your standards and speed are proven

## Section 3: The Power Offer

## Current Power Offer:

**Attention non-technical founders and entrepreneurs — If I offered to help you launch your SaaS app from scratch—with a working MVP in 10 days—without hiring a dev team or giving up equity… would you take me up on that offer?**

I've helped everyone from scrappy startups to giants like Apple and State Farm build and ship real products, fast.

As your fractional CTO, I'll help you turn raw ideas into scalable, revenue-ready MVPs with precision and speed. In just 10 days, you'll have a live, working product that real customers can use—and pay for. No fluff. No guesswork. Just results.

I only take 3 projects at a time. First come, first served.

You in?

## Notes:

-   With all the money they're saving with AI, they can invest in marketing and getting their first real users.
-   The old model of app creation, where you hire a dev team for hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, is broken. I've seen founders who were millionaires go broke before they got 10 paying customers.
-   With the advent of AI tooling, now that's not a problem.

# Notes

## What's Working Well

-   Your main offer is clear and compelling - a working MVP in 10 days is attention-grabbing
-   You've established credibility by mentioning work with major brands
-   The "fractional CTO" positioning is excellent - it offers expertise without equity demands
-   The limited availability ("only take 3 projects at a time") creates some natural scarcity

## Suggestions to Strengthen Emotional Connection

-   Paint a more vivid "before and after" picture

Before: "Imagine another month passing as you watch competitors launch while you're still stuck trying to find reliable developers..."
After: "Picture logging into your dashboard and seeing your first paying customers interacting with YOUR product, just days from now."

-   Add personal stakes

"Every day your idea sits unrealized is a day someone else might beat you to market. In today's AI-accelerated environment, waiting even a month can be the difference between leading your category or playing catch-up forever."

-   Reference the emotional journey

"I've seen the look on founders' faces when they finally see their vision come to life after months of frustration. Now imagine experiencing that victory in just days instead of months."

## Ideas to Add Urgency

-   Create a timeline connection

"The average founder spends 6-9 months building their MVP. By the time you'd be halfway through the traditional build cycle, my clients are already iterating on customer feedback and refining their product-market fit."

-   Add a market timing element

"We're at a unique moment where AI tools give us unprecedented speed, but most founders don't know how to leverage them properly. This advantage won't last forever as these tools become more widely adopted."

-   Consider a limited-time decision window

"Because I only work with three clients at a time, I need decisive partners. If you're interested, I ask for a decision within 48 hours of our consultation call."

-   Add a cost-of-delay calculation

"Every month of development delay doesn't just cost you in direct expenses - it's potentially thousands in lost revenue and market position. What would reaching revenue 3-6 months faster be worth to your business?"
