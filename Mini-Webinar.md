# SLIDE 2: AUTHORITY

## Joshua Cook

### Fractional CTO for Startups

#### Helped build products for:

-   Apple

[Speaker notes]
I'm Joshua Cook, and I've spent the last 15+ years helping both scrappy startups and giants like Apple and State Farm build and ship real products, fast. I've seen what works, what doesn't, and most importantly—I've discovered a way to dramatically accelerate the app development process for non-technical founders using the latest AI technologies and my technical expertise.

# SLIDE 4: GET THEM TO AGREE

## You probably already know...

-   Time to market is everything
-   Technical execution is a top reason startups fail
-   Traditional development takes 6-12 months

[Speaker notes]
You probably already know that in today's market, time to market is absolutely everything. Every day your idea sits unrealized is another day someone might beat you to launch. You likely also know that technical execution problems are one of the top three reasons startups fail—and that traditional development cycles can take anywhere from 6 to 12 months. That's practically a lifetime in today's fast-moving market. I'm betting you're nodding your head right now because you've either experienced this pain or you're desperately trying to avoid it.

---

# SLIDE 5: THE CHALLENGE

## But the problem is...

-   Non-technical founders get stuck in "tech hell"
-   Vetting freelancers wastes precious time
-   Most can't afford a full dev team
-   AI tools alone aren't enough

[Speaker notes]
But the problem is, if you're a non-technical founder, you're likely stuck in what I call "tech hell." You have this brilliant idea, but you don't know how to build it yourself. So you waste weeks or even months trying to vet freelancers or platforms that might help. Maybe you've tried to use some AI tools on your own but found they still require technical knowledge to implement effectively. And if you're like most founders, you simply don't have the capital to hire a full development team, especially before you've validated your idea with paying customers. It's a catch-22 that keeps many great ideas from ever seeing the light of day.

---

# SLIDE 6: SOLUTION BRIEFLY EXPLAINED

## The Rapid SaaS Framework:

### Your shortcut to a working MVP

[Speaker notes]
But luckily, I've developed what I call the Rapid SaaS Framework, which serves as your shortcut to a working MVP. It combines my decade of technical expertise with the latest AI development tools in a way that specifically works for non-technical founders. This isn't about building a fancy prototype that falls apart when real users touch it. This is about creating a functional, revenue-ready product that your first customers can actually use and pay for—in just 10 days.

---

# SLIDE 7: BENEFITS

## Best method we've discovered to:

-   Get to market 20x faster
-   Save $50k-$100k on initial development
-   Start collecting customer feedback immediately
-   Begin generating revenue in days, not months

[Speaker notes]
This framework is the best method we've discovered to help founders like you get to market up to 20 times faster than traditional development methods. You'll save anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 on initial development costs, which means you can invest that money in marketing and acquiring your first users instead. Most importantly, you'll start collecting real customer feedback immediately and can begin generating revenue in days, not months. Imagine how that changes the trajectory of your business when you can iterate based on actual user behavior instead of assumptions.

---

# SLIDE 8: OPEN LOOP

## I'll reveal all the details in a minute...

[Speaker notes]
And I'm going to reveal all the details to you in just a minute, including exactly how we structure this process to deliver results so quickly. But first, I need to explain WHY this approach works so well when traditional methods continue to fail so many founders.

---

# SLIDE 9: REASON WHY

## Why traditional development fails:

### The Founder's Technical Trap

[Speaker notes]
The reason traditional development approaches fail so many founders is what I call the "Founder's Technical Trap." See, the old model assumes you either need to become technical yourself, hire expensive developers, or give away equity to a technical co-founder. All of these approaches have serious drawbacks. Learning to code takes years. Hiring developers costs a fortune and requires technical management skills you don't have. And finding a technical co-founder who shares your vision can take months or years—if you find one at all. The trap keeps you stuck, while your competitors move forward.

---

# SLIDE 10: STEP 1

## STEP 1: Strategic Scoping Session

### 1-day intensive to map your MVP

[Speaker notes]
So here's how our process works. Step 1 is what we call the Strategic Scoping Session. This is a one-day intensive where I work directly with you to map out exactly what your MVP needs to include. Notice I said "needs"—not "wants." This is crucial because most founders try to build too much too soon. During this session, we identify the absolute core features that will allow you to validate your idea with real users. We map out user flows, data structures, and integration points, creating a lean blueprint that focuses exclusively on what will get you to revenue fastest.

---

# SLIDE 11: RESULTS OF STEP 1

## Results of this step:

-   Clear MVP blueprint
-   Feature prioritization
-   Technical roadmap
-   No bloat or scope creep

[Speaker notes]
The results of this step are powerful. You'll have a crystal-clear MVP blueprint that focuses only on what matters. We'll prioritize features based on what drives value for users, not what's technically interesting. You'll have a technical roadmap that extends beyond the MVP, so you know exactly how to evolve the product as you grow. And most importantly, we eliminate bloat and scope creep from day one—which is typically what causes development projects to drag on for months longer than they should.

---

# SLIDE 12: I'LL DO THIS FOR YOU

## I'll do this FOR YOU

### Save weeks of planning & avoid costly mistakes

[Speaker notes]
The best part? I'll do all of this FOR YOU. You don't need to become a product manager overnight or learn technical jargon. I've done this dozens of times and know exactly what questions to ask and what pitfalls to avoid. You'll save weeks of planning time and avoid the costly mistakes that most first-time founders make when defining their MVP. This alone can save you thousands of dollars and months of development time.

---

# SLIDE 13: TESTIMONIAL

## "Joshua helped us cut our development timeline from 6 months to just 2 weeks. We launched with paying customers immediately."

### Sarah K., FinTech Founder

[Speaker notes]
Don't just take my word for it. Sarah, a FinTech founder I worked with last year, was quoted a 6-month timeline and a $150,000 budget by a development agency. After going through our process, we launched her core product in just two weeks, and she signed up her first three paying customers within days of launch. That early validation allowed her to raise a seed round at a much higher valuation than she initially expected.

---

# SLIDE 14: STEP 2

## STEP 2: Rapid Build Phase

### Days 2-9: Building your functional MVP

[Speaker notes]
Once we have our blueprint, we move to Step 2: the Rapid Build Phase. This is where the magic happens. From days 2 through 9, I'll work with my team to build your functional MVP using a combination of AI-powered development tools and our custom frameworks. We focus on creating an architecture that's both fast to build AND scalable for future growth. Unlike traditional development where you'd wait weeks to see progress, you'll get daily updates and actually see your product taking shape hour by hour.

---

# SLIDE 15: RESULTS OF STEP 2

## Results of this step:

-   Functional application
-   User authentication
-   Core features working
-   Ready for real users

[Speaker notes]
The results of this step are game-changing. You'll have a fully functional application with user authentication, your core features working as designed, and an interface that's ready for real users. This isn't a mockup or a prototype—it's a real product that users can sign up for and start using immediately. And because we've built it using modern cloud infrastructure, it's ready to scale as your user base grows.

# SLIDE 17: STEP 3

## STEP 3: Launch & Optimization

### Day 10: Go live and acquire first users

[Speaker notes]
The final step in our process is Launch and Optimization. On day 10, we'll go live with your product and implement the systems you need to acquire your first users. This includes setting up analytics to track user behavior, implementing feedback mechanisms so you can learn directly from customers, and configuring the tools you'll need to manage and support your early adopters. Many founders spend months building and then realize they have no plan for getting users. We bake this into the process from day one.

---

# SLIDE 18: RESULTS OF STEP 3

## Results of this step:

-   Live product in users' hands
-   Data collection systems active
-   Ready to collect payments
-   Clear path to scale

[Speaker notes]
The results of this final step put you miles ahead of most founders. You'll have a live product in users' hands just 10 days after we begin. Your data collection systems will be active so you can make informed decisions about what to build next. You'll be ready to collect payments from day one, turning your idea into a revenue-generating business immediately. And you'll have a clear path to scale both technically and in terms of your user acquisition strategy.

# SLIDE 19: CASE STUDY

## Case Study: TaskFlow

-   Idea to MVP: 8 days
-   First paying user: Day 11
-   Break-even on our fee: Month 1
-   Now at $12K MRR

[Speaker notes]
Let me share a quick case study. TaskFlow came to us with just an idea for a project management tool with some unique AI capabilities. We took them from idea to MVP in just 8 days. They acquired their first paying customer on day 11, and by the end of their first month, they'd made enough revenue to cover our entire fee. Today, just six months later, they're at $12,000 in monthly recurring revenue and growing steadily. This is the power of getting to market quickly and iterating based on real user feedback.
