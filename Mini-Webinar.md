[OFFER]

What if I could help you launch your SaaS app idea from scratch—with a real, working MVP—in just 10 days…

Without hiring a dev team…

Without giving up equity…

Without wasting another second stuck in technical limbo?

Would you take me up on that offer?

[WHO I AM]

Who am I?  

My name's Josh Cook. I’m a fractional CTO and product strategist.

I’ve spent the past 15+ years building digital products for everyone from small, scrappy startups to major brands like Apple and State Farm.

I know what it takes to go from idea to launch—fast, and I've also seen what hasn't worked.

But today, I’m not here to talk about big brands.

I’m here to talk to you.

The founder.

The visionary.

The entrepreneur with an amazing idea who’s tired of watching competitors sprint past while you’re still tangled up in tech chaos.

[HEADLINE / SOLUTION]

Because what I’m about to share with you could be the exact shortcut you need to get your product launched, live, and in the hands of paying users—in record time.

Not six months. Not three. Ten days.

Real product. Real users. Real momentum.

[GET THEM TO AGREE]

Now you probably already know this:

The faster you can get feedback, the faster you can find product-market fit.

According to CB Insights, over 1/3 of startups fail because they run out of cash before they find product-market fit.

It's also well known that early-stage startups who spend more time validating their market and offer are more likely to avoid cash flow issues and achieve product-market fit.

And we all know that getting more feedback earlier is the fastest way to validating your idea and finding that coveted Product-Market Fit.

And what's the fastest way to get feedback?

Launching a real MVP that real customers can use and pay for.

[THE CHALLENGE]

But here’s the problem.

You’re not technical.

You've thought about doing it the conventional way — Bringing on a technical cofounder or CTO to help build your product.

But that's a big risk.

You're giving up massive equity, and you're taking on a partner who you may not know, trust, or align with.

You're committed to your idea, but are they as committed as you, or simply riding your coattails looking to do as little as possible for a quick exit and a big payday?

Or you may have flirted with AI tools or no-code builders — but hit a wall when things got even slightly complex.

You’ve probably tried to vet freelancers or no-code agencies that made big promises… and then ghosted or underdelivered.

You could try to build a team… but between ballooning costs, never-ending timelines, and equity-hungry startup studios, it feels like the system is rigged against you.

And meanwhile?

Your idea is just sitting there. Unlaunched. Unproven.

And with every passing week, someone else might be launching your idea before you even get started.

[SOLUTION BRIEFLY EXPLAINED]

But it doesn’t have to be like that.

Because I’ve created a lean, lightning-fast, AI-enhanced process to help non-technical founders like you turn ideas into fully functional MVPs—in just 10 days.

Not a pitch deck.

Not a prototype.

Not a fake “coming soon” landing page.

A real, working, usable app that real customers can interact with.

This isn’t a course. It’s not a template.

It’s done with you, and done for you.

As your fractional CTO, I personally guide the strategy, own the build, and ensure you get a product that doesn’t just work—but has a clear path to revenue.

[BENEFITS OF THE SOLUTION]

This process is the best method I’ve ever seen for:

Launching fast without wasting months on wrong tech choices.

Getting to customer #1 without giving up equity.

Using AI tools to build smarter, faster—and save you tens of thousands in development costs.

[OPEN LOOP]

And I’m going to walk you through exactly how it works in just a minute…

But first, let me tell you why this approach is so different—and why it works so well for founders like you.

[REASON WHY]

The old way of building startups is broken.

Founders used to raise $250K, burn through it on bloated dev teams, and still end up with an unusable product six months later.

I’ve seen it firsthand.

I’ve seen smart, well-funded founders spend over a million dollars before getting a single paying customer—just to realize they built the wrong thing.

But with today’s AI-powered stack and 10+ years of battle-tested product expertise?

You can skip all that.

You don’t need 6 months.

You don’t need a dev team.

You don’t need a cofounder.

What you do need is a fast path to a real MVP—and a partner who knows how to get you there.

[STEP 1]

Here’s what we do first:

We nail your MVP strategy.

We map your product idea into a lean, launchable version focused on outcomes, not features.

I help you define what to build—and more importantly, what not to build.

Results of this?

→ Clarity.

→ Speed.

→ You’re no longer guessing what to build—you’re locked in on the shortest path to revenue.

[TESTIMONIAL / RESULT]

I worked with a founder just like you last month—non-technical, great idea, big audience—but totally stuck.

In 48 hours, we defined the MVP and kicked off development.

10 days later? Live product.

Her first paying customer came that week.

[I'LL DO THIS FOR YOU]

And when you work with me—I do this step for you.

You don’t have to figure out the tech stack, or write specs, or manage freelancers.

You just tell me the vision. I map the path.

[STEP 2]

Next, we build.

But not like you’ve seen before.

No bloated team. No vague timelines.

I personally lead the build using AI tooling, my dev network, and lean startup principles.

Everything we do is designed to ship fast and iterate smarter.

Results of this?

→ Your product is built with best practices baked in.

→ It’s something you can demo to investors, sell to customers, and build on going forward.

[WANT US TO DO ALL THIS FOR YOU?]

So if you’re thinking:

“Wow, this is exactly what I’ve been trying to figure out…”

Then yeah—we should talk.

Scroll down and apply right now.

Let’s see if we’re a good fit.

[TESTIMONIAL / RESULT]

Another founder I worked with came in burnt out from a $30K failed dev experiment.

Ten days with me?

We launched her MVP.

She showed it to her community—and 5 customers signed up the first weekend.

She told me it felt like a “miracle after six months of misery.”

[STEP 3]

Finally—we optimize for launch and traction.

I’ll help you:

Set up analytics and user feedback tools

Get clarity on what to test next

Position your MVP so users understand it, and want to try it

Results of this?

→ You’re no longer in theory-land. You’re in the game.

→ You’re getting real feedback, real usage, and real learning that actually moves the business forward.

[RESULTS / CASE STUDIES]

I’ve worked with startups who went from idea to funded in 30 days…

Founders who were stuck for months who now have real, paying customers.

People who were this close to giving up—who now have something real.

[HOW WE’LL HELP YOU - RECAP]

Here’s what we’ll do together:

Step 1: Nail your MVP plan so you build the right thing.

Step 2: Build a working, lean, beautiful MVP in 10 days.

Step 3: Launch fast, get feedback, and prep for traction.

[PLUS, WE’LL EVEN…]

We’ll even help you create demo videos, pitch decks, and investor-ready assets if that’s part of your plan.

Because this isn’t just about building an app—it’s about building momentum.
