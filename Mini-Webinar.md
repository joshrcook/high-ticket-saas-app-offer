[OFFER]

"What if I could help you could compress the first 6 months of your startup… into the next 10 days?"

Without hiring a dev team…

Without giving up equity to bring in a technical co-founder…

Without wasting another second stuck in technical limbo?

Would you take me up on that offer?

[WHO I AM]

Who am I?

My name's Josh Cook. I'm a tech expert who helps founders turn ideas into real products.

I've spent the past 15+ years building digital products for everyone from small, scrappy startups to major brands like Apple and State Farm.

I know what it takes to go from idea to launch—fast, and I've also seen what hasn't worked.

But today, I'm not here to talk about big brands.

I'm here to talk to you.

The entrepreneur with an amazing idea who's tired of watching competitors sprint past while you're still tangled up in tech chaos.

[HEADLINE / SOLUTION]

Because what I'm about to share with you could be the exact shortcut you need to get your product launched, live, and in the hands of paying users—in record time.

Not a year. Not 180 days. Not 90 days. Ten days flat.

A real product with real users generating real momentum for your business.

[GET THEM TO AGREE]

Now you probably already know this, but...

... the startup world can be a brutal place.

About 90% of startups fail.

According to a report by CB Insights, one third of those are still trying to find product market fit when they fail.

Another third spend too much money before finding profitability.

What does that mean for you?

It means that if you can get your product in front of your market _faster_ so that you iterate on feedback and find product market fit

You have a much better chance of making it.

And what's the fastest way to get feedback?

Launching a real MVP that real customers can use and pay for.

[THE CHALLENGE]

But here's the problem.

You're not technical.

You've thought about doing it the conventional way — Bringing on a technical cofounder or CTO to help build your product.

But that's a big risk.

You're giving up massive equity, and you're taking on a partner who you may not know, trust, or align with.

You're committed to your idea, but are they as committed as you, or simply riding your coattails looking to do as little as possible for a quick exit and a big payday?

Or you may have flirted with AI tools or no-code builders — but hit a wall when things got even slightly complex.

You may have also gone the freelancing route, but we all know that finding good talent is hard, and expensive.

And meanwhile?

Your idea is just sitting there. Unlaunched. Unproven.

And with every passing week, someone else might be launching your idea before you even get started.

Meanwhile, the startup landscape has shifted.

Smart founders are using AI tooling to accelerate their progress faster and cheaper than ever, yet you've never quite figured out how to make these products work for you.

[SOLUTION BRIEFLY EXPLAINED]

But it doesn't have to be like that.

How do I know? Because just a few weeks ago, I was in your shoes.

I was building my own app that I wanted to bring to the market, but even having tech experience, I struggled to use AI tools to help me build anything that looked halfway decent that someone would actually use.

That's when I unlocked a secret formula.

I found that by combining a well-planned approach with a unique mix of AI tools, each with their own strengths, that I could build amazing products in record time without having to code anything by hand.

When I saw the power of the approach I used to build an app in less than a week, I realized how powerful this could be for other founders.

[BENEFITS OF THE SOLUTION]

Gone would be all of the wasted "build time" that a normal startup has to take on.

Startups could launch extremely fast without making awful tech choices or accumulating tons of tech debt.

And they could get to customer #1 in just a matter of days.

In short, this process could short-circuit the entire startup journey and compress the process of finding product-market fit into just a few short weeks.

[OPEN LOOP]

Now you're probably wondering how all of this works...

And I'm going to walk you through exactly how it works in just a minute…

But first, let me tell you why this approach is so different—and why it works so well for founders like you.

[REASON WHY]

The old way of building startups is dead.

You've probably heard about founders who have raised capital just to burn through it on bloated dev teams, and still end up with an unusable product six months later.

I've seen it firsthand.

I've seen smart, well-funded founders spend over a million dollars just to get 5 paying customers and realize they built the wrong thing.

But that doesn't have to happen to your or your idea, technical or not.

You don't need a year of building in a vaccuum.

You don't need a dev team.

You don't need a cofounder.

You can skip all that and go straight to validating your idea with your first customers _with the right tools and the right guidance_

And the process that I've discovered is actually 3 distinct steps that, when followed precisely, yield amazing results:

-   **Strategize:** How to use an ancient principle to target the most profitable customers with the biggest pain points.
-   **Build:** The powerful two-step process to creating amazing AI designs without needing any design skills.
-   **Launch:** The secret to creating a great product instead of a technical dumpster-fire while having AI do all the coding.

[STEP 1]

Here's what we do first:

We nail your MVP strategy using the 80/20 rule.

You've probably heard of this rule before. It basically says that most of your value comes from a small subset of features.

We already know that building a bigger and more complex an app is way harder than building the features that actually matter.

I call this the killer feature.

Deep down, every founder knows that for any app, there's one killer feature.

So why not build your app around that killer feature rather than building 10 or 20 features that are just okay?

I help you identify exactly which features belong in that vital 20% — and more importantly, which 80% to cut for now after you've validated your killer feature.

What will we have at the end of this process?

-   complete requirements and user stories to help provide clarity at every step.

-   Clarity on what actually moves the needle.

→ 5X faster development speed.

→ No more guessing what to build — instead, you're laser-focused on the shortest path to revenue.

<!-- [TESTIMONIAL / RESULT]

I worked with a founder just like you last month—non-technical, great idea, big audience—but totally stuck.

In 48 hours, we defined the MVP and kicked off development.

10 days later? Live product.

Her first paying customer came that week. -->

[I'LL DO THIS FOR YOU]

And when you work with me — I do this step for you. You just give me what you have already, and I'll help dial it in and ensure that it's centered around the killer feature.

You don't have to figure out the tech stack, or write specs, or manage freelancers.

You just tell me the vision. I map the path.

[STEP 2]

Next, we design & build.

But not like you've seen before.

Now, if you want to be both disappointed and amazed by AI tools, you should start with a code editor.

If you've ever tried these tools before, you probably know what I'm talking about. You put in a prompt that gives you _something_, just not what you wanted. And the more you keep prompting, the more it seems like you can't get it to do _exactly what you want_.

What I discovered is twofold:

1. There's no such thing as the perfect AI tool. You have to use the right AI tools for the right job. Each one has it's own strengths and weaknesses.
2. The longer you spend on your design, the less time you'll spend on developing your tool. Just like the pre-AI era, this still holds true.

My process is super simple:

1. Wireframe. Here's where you dial in exactly what the app should look like.
2. Design. Here's where you take the wireframes and turn them into designs without "over-designing". Design is great, but it can't turn a bad product into a great one. Your design should get out of the way and let your features do the talking.
3. Build. After we have great designs, I found an amazing way to turn them into functional apps in a way that retains the design to a pixel.

After this step

Results of this?

→ Your product is built with best practices baked in.

→ It's something you can demo to investors, sell to customers, and build on going forward.

So if you're thinking:

"Wow, this is exactly what I've been trying to figure out…"

Then yeah—we should talk.

Scroll down and apply right now.

Let's see if we're a good fit.

[STEP 3]

Launch:

The launch step is where my process really shines.

Most startup founders blow their entire budget on building a great product — and leave nothing for getting it in front of users.

My launch process flips that script.

You'll spend so much less on the build, that you can afford to spend more on what actually grows your product: getting real users and getting real feedback fast.

When we deploy your app (with your custom domain) you'll have professional infrastructure backing you up every step of the way, without headaches or downtime.

Not only that, but we'll build in analytics from the start, ensuring you'll have a strong understanding of how those users are using your app.

Results of this?

→ You're no longer in theory-land. You're in the game.

→ You're getting real feedback, real usage, and real learning that actually moves the business forward.

[TESTIMONIAL / RESULT]

Another founder I worked with came in burnt out from a $30K failed dev experiment.

Ten days with me?

We launched her MVP.

She showed it to her community—and 5 customers signed up the first weekend.

She told me it felt like a "miracle after six months of misery."
