Use the examples (@Copy of Mini-Webinar\_ Simplified Template.txt and @Copy of Module 3.3 - Mini-Webinar Template (Course Share Version).txt ) to create a webinar in text format. Before each slide go ahead and add an indicator that it's a new slide and add a space for notes. Use the @Power Offer.md to help craft the webinar. The entire webinar should last anywhere from 10-15 minutes, so keep that in mind when creating this webinar. Also, for each slide, ensure the written notes that say _exactly_ what the speaker should say when the slide is shown to the audience. Make the slides snappy to hold attention â€” don't fill them with words or hover on one slide too long.
