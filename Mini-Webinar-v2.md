[OFFER]

Imagine compressing the first six months of your startup journey into just ten days. What if you could bypass the usual hurdles and launch your SaaS app idea with a real, working MVP—without the need for a dev team, without giving up equity, and without wasting another second stuck in technical limbo?

Would you take me up on that offer?

Everyone knows AI is revolutionizing the startup world, but most founders are still struggling to harness its true potential. While they experiment with basic AI tools, they're missing the strategic frameworks that could save them months of development and hundreds of thousands of dollars. In this short video, I'll reveal my proprietary method that I stumbled upon to help anyone leverage AI to build fully-functional apps in just days instead of months—at a fraction of the traditional cost. This isn't about using a single AI tool; it's about orchestrating multiple AI technologies in a specific sequence that amplifies their power exponentially.

[WHO I AM]

Who am I?

My name's Josh Cook, and I'm a tech expert with over 15 years of experience in building digital products. I've worked with everyone from small, scrappy startups to major brands like Apple and State Farm. I've seen firsthand what works and what doesn't.

But today, I'm not here to talk about big brands. I'm here to talk to you—the entrepreneur with an amazing idea who's tired of watching competitors sprint past while you're still tangled up in tech chaos.

[HEADLINE / SOLUTION]

What I'm about to share with you could be the exact shortcut you need to get your product launched, live, and in the hands of paying users—in record time. Not a year. Not 180 days. Not even 90 days. Ten days flat.

A real product with real users generating real momentum for your business. This isn't just about building an app; it's about building a foundation for success.

[OPEN LOOP]

Now you're probably wondering how all of this works...

And I'll walk you through it in just a minute.

But first, let me tell you why this works so well for founders like you.

[GET THEM TO AGREE]

Now you probably already know this, but...

The startup world can be brutal, wouldn't you agree?. About 90% of startups fail. According to a report by CB Insights, one-third of those are still trying to find product-market fit when they go under. Another third spend too much money before getting profitable.

What does that mean for you? It means if you can get your product in front of users faster, so you can iterate on feedback and find product-market fit sooner—you have a much better shot at succeeding.

And what's the fastest way to get feedback? Launching a real MVP that real customers can use and pay for.

[THE CHALLENGE]

But here's the problem...

You're not technical. You might've considered the conventional route: Bringing on a technical cofounder or CTO. But that means giving up equity—massive equity. And on top of that, you'll be taking on a partner who you may not know, trust, or align with.

Are they as committed as you? Or are they riding your coattails, doing as little as possible for a quick exit and a big payday?

Or maybe you flirted with AI tools or no-code builders—but hit a wall when things got even slightly complex. Maybe you hired freelancers... and soon realized that you either get cheap, low quality people or expensive, high quality people, but there is no middle ground.

Meanwhile, your idea? Still sitting there. Unlaunched. Unproven. And with every passing week, someone else might be launching your idea before you even get started.

The startup landscape has shifted. Smart founders are using AI tooling to move faster and cheaper than ever... but you haven't quite figured out how to make these tools work for you.

[SOLUTION BRIEFLY EXPLAINED]

But it doesn't have to be like that.

How do I know?

Because a little while ago, I was in your shoes.

Even with tech experience, I struggled to use AI tools to build something useful. Every tool I tried left me more frustrated than the last. No AI tool seemed to be able to come close to my vision.

That's when I cracked the code.

By combining a well-planned product strategy with a carefully selected mix of AI tools, I was able to:

-   Build my completely custom app for my business
-   With no custom code
-   Without any design skills
-   In less than a week

When I realized how powerful this approach could be, I knew I had to bring it to other founders.

What I later realized is that there were 3 secrets to building fast MVP's faster than ever with AI that I had uncovered.

And in many ways, they relate to a game of golf. These are the keys:

1. Select the right club
2. Prep your swing
3. Get the right coach

If our goal is to get our ball in the hole in as little time as possible, these are the steps we have to follow.

[STEP 1]

[BENEFITS OF THE SOLUTION]

No more wasting months building the wrong thing. No more tech debt from poorly scoped builds. No more waiting for dev teams to catch up.

With this approach, you can:

-   Launch extremely fast
-   Make smart tech decisions
-   Get to your first paying customer in days, not months

In short:

You can compress the entire startup process—from idea to validation to revenue—into just a few short weeks.

Consider this: traditional development cycles can take months, if not years, and often result in products that miss the mark. By using AI tools, you can iterate rapidly, testing and refining your product in real-time based on user feedback.

[REASON WHY]

The old way of building startups is dead.

You've heard the stories:

Founders raising capital just to burn through it on bloated dev teams, spending 6+ months on a product that never ships, or worse, it ships and... no one wants it.

I've seen it firsthand.

I know a founder who spent a million dollars and walked away with 5 paying customers. They built the wrong thing, but they realized it far too late in the game.

And the kicker?

They could've figured that out in just a couple of weeks and adjusted — if they had just followed the process I'm laying out here.

[NEW OPPORTUNITY]

That's what this is about.

I'm offering you a faster, smarter, AI-powered way to:

-   Validate your idea
-   Launch a working MVP
-   Get to revenue faster

All with my guidance as your fractional CTO.

I help you:

-   Avoid the mistakes
-   Leverage the tools
-   And bring your vision to life without giving up equity

And we do it all in 10 days.

[SOCIAL PROOF & CREDIBILITY]

I've worked with:

-   Startups you've never heard of that are now crushing it
-   Fortune 100 brands like Apple and State Farm

And I've helped them all do one thing:

Ship great products. Fast.

Now I want to help you do the same.

[LIMITED AVAILABILITY]

I only work with three clients at a time.

Because this isn't some agency churn machine.

This is real partnership. Real commitment. Real outcomes.
